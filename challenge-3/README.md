# Challenge 3: Programming Contest
Challenge 3 was a programming contest comprising 5 problems. See the PDF file in this folder for the questions.

## Result
We couldn't solve any of the problems within the memory and run time limits during the challenge.

## Reflections
From this challenge, I learned that a data scientist must have a broad range of skills. In particular, computer science fundamentals like data structures and algorithms, operating systems, databases, networking and software engineering are highly-relevant. It is not enough to know how to manipulate data, visualise data, and build models.

I resolve to work harder in building my computer science fundamentals to become a more well-rounded data scientist.
